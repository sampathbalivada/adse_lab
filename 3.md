### 10 Architectural Inferences from `postgres.c`

1.  **Process-per-Connection Model**: The server follows a "one backend process per client connection" model. The code in `postgres.c` forms the core logic for one of these backend processes, which is spawned by a master "postmaster" process to handle a single user session.

2.  **Strict Frontend/Backend Separation**: The architecture is fundamentally a client-server model. This file is the "backend" (or "traffic cop"), which executes commands, while the "frontend" is the client application sending requests over the network.

3.  **Phased Query Execution Pipeline**: SQL processing is handled in a distinct, multi-stage pipeline. `postgres.c` orchestrates the flow through these stages: Parsing -> Analysis/Rewriting -> Planning/Optimization -> Execution.

4.  **Highly Modular Design**: The extensive list of `#include` directives for components like `parser/`, `optimizer/`, `access/`, and `storage/` shows that PostgreSQL is built from many specialized, independent modules. `postgres.c` acts as a high-level coordinator for these modules.

5.  **Explicit, Hierarchical Memory Management**: The heavy use of `MemoryContext` demonstrates a sophisticated, non-automatic memory management system. Memory is allocated in specific contexts (e.g., per-message, per-transaction) which can be deleted in their entirety to prevent leaks and manage resources efficiently.

6.  **Centrality of the Transaction System**: Transaction management is not an afterthought; it's a fundamental part of command processing. Functions like `start_xact_command` and `finish_xact_command` wrap almost all operations, ensuring that nearly everything executes within a transaction.

7.  **Built-in Support for Plan Caching**: The logic for handling prepared statements (both named and unnamed) and the `CachedPlanSource` structure reveal a built-in mechanism for caching the execution plans of queries, which is a critical performance optimization.

8.  **Signal-Based Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: The code is rich with signal handling (`CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS`, `pqsignal.h`) and latches. This indicates a reliance on traditional Unix-style signals for asynchronous communication, such as for query cancellation or shutdown requests from the postmaster.

9.  **Integrated Replication Awareness**: The inclusion of headers like `replication/walsender.h` and checks within the main command processing loop show that replication is not an external tool but a deeply integrated feature that the core backend is aware of.

10. **Support for Multiple Client Protocols**: The file contains distinct logic paths for the "Simple Query" protocol (`exec_simple_query`) and the "Extended Query" protocol (`exec_parse_message`, `exec_bind_message`), showing the architecture is designed to support both basic clients (like `psql`) and advanced drivers (like JDBC/ODBC).
